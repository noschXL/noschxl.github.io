# The Malware
## Stage 1: The Minecraft Mod

The orignial mod was made for Fabric, it was supposed to be a dupe for the version 1.21,  
though after putting it in [Recaf](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf)  
i saw that it wasnt.

cause who would put a file in there called *mysecret.dll*
`
$ ls
-> assets    Dupe1.21.jar     META-INF      newmod.mixins.json
   cfg.json  fabric.mod.json  mysecret.dll  newmod-refmap.json
   dev       LICENSE_newmod   native
`
